# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overiew 

The purpose of the project was to assist Pewlett-Hackard with creating a employee database. By turning the csv files into table, we are able to determine the number of employees that are about to retire. We used PostgresSQL and pgAdmin to create the database, tables, and run queries. With this information, this company will have broader idea on recruiting to replace the retiring employees. 

## Results
- Pewlett-hackard has 300,024 employee and 90,393 employees are set retire.
- More than half of the employees that are retiring are in senior levels
- 1,549 employees have been identified as eligible for the mentor ship program
- None of the eligible mentors are managers
